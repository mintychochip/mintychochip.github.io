# prompt
For your first app, keep it simple. Set up a new project called "Hello" and complete the following:
1. Create your first view.
2. The view will contain one button with the text "Hello".
3. When the "Hello" button is clicked it should launch a new view/model/alert.
4. The new view/model will have a single text label that says "Hello World" and an OK button.
5. When the OK button is clicked the application should go back to the first view.
